    "## MLE vs OLS\n",
    "At the beginning of this lesson, we demonstrated how the simple regression line could be fit by minimising the sum of squared errors. This is known as the method of *ordinary least squares* (OLS). OLS is useful because it is easy to conceptualise and results in a simple set of equations for finding estimates. Because of this, OLS is generally considered *the* method used for estimating linear models. However, models that do not assume a normal distribution or those that assume more complex correlational and variance structures cannot be estimated with OLS. As such, OLS is actually something of a niche approach that gets abandoned quickly as models get more complex. Because of this, it is much more helpful to consider a *likelihood* approach to estimation[^searlefoot]. The principle of the likelihood is widely applicable across may different types of model, as well as being fundamental to Bayesian methods. As such, we can consider MLE as our singular generic method of estimation that will be applicable across this entire course."

We can think about it as taking a guess for the parameter values, then calculating how probable those guesses make the data we have collected. It is like asking the question: \"how likely would it have been to collect my data, if these were the parameter values?\".

The resultant errors are then used to estimate the variance by running standard MLE (hence why it is sometimes known as *residual* maximum likelihood). The removal of the effects allows the correction to be automatically taken into account, meaning the variance estimate is *unbiased*.

In effect, the degrees of freedom capture the number of independent pieces of information that are available for estimating some quantity. For example, consider a list of numbers of size $n$. If we then transform that list such that the sum of its values is 0, we are imposing a *constraint* on the number of possible values that list could contain. In this situation, $n-1$ of the items in the list are free to have any value we want. However, in order for the constraint to be met, the final item in the list will be *forced* to have a particular value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this with an example. Take the following list of values\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\left[1,2,6,8\\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that we transform $y$ to produce a new list, but impose the constraint that the sum of the values must be 0. This is done implicitly during mean-centering (i.e. subtracting the mean from each value), which would give\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y^{\\ast} = \\left[-3.25, -2.25, 1.75, 3.75\\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice here that the sum of the first 3 values is $-3.25 + -2.25 + 1.75 = -3.75$, which is the same as the final value with the sign flipped. This is no coincidence. In fact, we can choose any arbitrary set of values for the first 3 numbers. For instance\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y^{\\ast} = \\left[27, 4, -2, ?\\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The only limitation, is that the final value must negate the sum of these first 3 values, such that the overall sum is 0. This would give\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y^{\\ast} = \\left[27, 4, -2, -29\\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this example, $y$ has 4 degrees of freedom, but $y^{\\ast}$ has $n-1 = 3$ degrees of freedom, because the value of element 4 is *constrained* by the fact it must sum to 0. This means that $y^{\\ast}$ cannot consist of any numbers, rather it is constrained to be one of the set of numbers where the final value negates the sum of the first 3. The final value is therefore *dependent* on the first 3 and there are only 3 independent pieces of information here, not 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of this for statistical models is that the act of estimation *imposes a constraint* on the values that are produced. Although our outcomes $y$ starts with $n$ degrees of freedom, estimating parameters limits the number of possible values that can be produced by the model. For the residuals, their values are constrained by the parameter estimates. Each new parameter \"uses up\" a single degree of freedom. So if we have $k$ parameters, then the number of residual degrees of freedom is $n-k$. For simple regression, $k = 2$ (the slope and the intercept) and so the first $n-2$ residuals are free to be any possible value, but the value of the final 2 are constrained by the estimated values of $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$. This also has a direct connection with Bessel's correction, because estimating the variance of a sample requires an estimate of the mean. This constrains the number of independent pieces of information that can be used to estimate the variance from $n$ to $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of degrees of freedom can be quite difficult to grasp. In fact, the origin of the concept came from Fisher's geometric perspective on linear models. Unfortunately, this requires a much deeper understanding of linear models than we will have time to establish on this course. In brief, we conceptualise quantities such as the residuals as vectors (arrows) in multidimensional space. The number of dimensions these vectors occupy is given by the degrees of freedom. As such, to compare vectors that lie in different numbers of dimensions, we summarise them by producing an *average value per-dimension*. This makes the act of dividing quantities by their degrees of freedom make more sense, but this is not a perspective we would recommend trying to master at this stage. However, it is worth knowing that a more intuitive perspective on degrees of freedom does exist, if you want to look into it at a later date.\n",

    "[^likprobsfoot]: This is a problem of getting values of 0 due to issues with computational precision when working with many small probabilities. Taking logs not only changes the scale so that this does not happen, but it also turns *multiplication* into *summation*. Historically, this made calculating the likelihood much easier by hand. If you ever want to get back to the likelihood value, you can just undo the logs by using `exp(loglik)`.\n",

    "[^bayesfoot]: This may seem like the wrong quantity. Surely, we are interested in $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})$? In other words, finding the parameters that are most probable, given the data. Unfortunately, evaluating the probability $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})$ requires Bayesian methods and so cannot be evaluated from a purely Frequentist perspective.\n",
