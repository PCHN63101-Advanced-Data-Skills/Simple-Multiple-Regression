It is like asking the question: \"how likely would it have been to collect the data that we have collected, if these were the parameter values?\".

    "### Exact Solutions\n",
    "The application of ML given above is sometimes known as *iterative* ML, highlighting the fact that in certain applications of ML, an iterative algorithm is unnecessary. This is because a single solution that maximise the likelihood function can be derived, meaning we can determine the equation that will give us the solution without the need to search around in the parameter space to find it. One example of this is linear models. If we assume a normal distribution for the outcome variable, we can work out an *exact* equation for those estimates that maximises the likelihood. Although the derivation of this is beyond the scope of this lesson, it turns out that the exact solution is *identical* to the OLS equations for the slope and intercept. As such, ML agrees with OLS and we can think of the estimating equations as either an application of OLS *or* as an application of ML."

In effect, REML estimates the residual variance by first *adjusting* for the effects of the predictors from the data and then running ML. This adjustment allows the loss of degrees of freedom to be automatically taken into account. Although it might be tempting to think we can just use the residuals for this purpose, because the residuals are technically *not* i.i.d., this will not work. Instead, you have to use other means of forcing the removal of the predictor effects to be i.i.d. This gets quite complicated, but should give you something of a flavour of how REML works. "
