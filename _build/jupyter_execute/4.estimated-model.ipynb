    "# The Estimated Model\n",
    "So, at this point, we can think of our parameter estimates either as those that minimise the sum of squared errors or, more generally, those values that maximise the likelihood (i.e. make the data most probable). As argued previously, the likelihood perspective is more universally applicable and so it is useful to think of the estimates in proabilistic terms. As such, if our data are truly drawn from a normal distribution then these parameter values make the data more likely than any other possible combination of values."

    "## Simple Regression in `R`\n",
    "As indicated in other parts of this lesson, the `R` function we use to fit a simple regression model is `lm()`. We specify this model *symbolically* using the `R` formula interface, which we can think of as specifying the *mean function* we want `lm()` to use. Because linear models have a constant variance, there is no option to specify any other variance function. In the example below, the model formula is given by `mpg ~ wt`, where the `~` symbol (called a *tilde*) is used to denote that `mpg` should be modelled as a function of `wt`. This is used instead of `=` because the equals symbol is already used to define named arguments within a function (e.g.`data=mtcars`). The `~` also provides a nice connection with the mathematical notation for the distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fit the model, we call `lm()` and then save the estimated model to an object we call `mod`. Inside `mod` are all the results from fitting the model. If we call `summary()` on the fitted object, we get a results table, as shown below."

    "### The Slope\n",
    "We start with the slope of the regression line because this is typically of *most* interest. In short, there are two elements of note for the slope: its *magnitude* and its *direction*. The magnitude is given by the actual numeric value of the slope. This is interpreted as the amount that $y$ changes for a *unit increase* in $x$. In context, this tells us how much MPG changes if we increase Weight by 1. Interpreting this therefore depends upon what a change of Weight by 1 actually means. For the `mtcars` dataset, `wt` is measured in units of 1,000 lbs. So a unit change for this variable corresponds to an *increase* in weight of 1,000 lbs. As such, our estimated slope indicates that an increase in weight of 1,000 lbs results in a change in average MPG of 5.3445. In addition, if we look at the *sign* of the estimate, we can infer the *direction* of this relationship. Because the estimate is *negative*, this corresponds to a *reduction* in MPG. So, for each additional 1,000 lbs of weight, MPG decreases by 5.3445.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully it is clear from this description that the parameter estimates are on the scale of the *outcome variable*, but depend upon the scale of the predictor for interpretation. If we changed the scaling of `wt` to actual measurements of lbs (by multiplying it by 1,000), the model fit would be the same, but the scale of the estimates would shift. In this case, a unit change would mean an increase in Weight of 1 lbs rather than 1,000 lbs. For instance"

    "Either way, this means that, on average, the data deviates from the regression line by around 3.046 MPG. This is quite small on the scale of MPG, and so would seem quite good. However, on its own, we do not really have a way to interpret this value. As such, we tend to treat the variance or standard deviation as a *relative* measure during the course of model building. Our aim, very generally, is to find the model that makes this value as *small* as possible. Returing back to our conceptualisation from earlier of\n",

    "our aim is to find the model that partitions the largest chunk of the total variance into the variance explained by the regression line, thus making the variance attributable to error as small as possible. This will have a direct influence on *inference*, as we will see next week, but also makes intuitive sense. From this perspective, we will use variance as a relative measure to see whether one model is able to reduce the error variance more than another. We will see examples that formalise this more when we get to the concept of ANOVAs a little later on this unit."

    "## Visualising the Estimates\n",
    "As a final part of this section, one of the most important things we can do to aid interpretation is to *visualise* the model. For simple regression, this typically means drawing the estimated regression line over a scatter plot of the data. This provides an immediate visual sense of all the numeric elements discussed above. Although we will see more fleixble approaches to plotting using the `effects` package later, for the moment we will just demonstrate some simple methods of visualisation in base `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below shows how to make a basic scatterplot with a regression line superimposed. We first create the scatterplot using the basic `plot()` function. We can then add the regression line using the `abline()` function, which has a useful `reg` option where we pass it the model object and the line is drawn automatically."

    "This plot is not going to win any awards for visual style, but it is simple and effective as a quick means of drawing the model fit. It is the sort of plot we would use during the process of analysis, just to have a quick look, as there is no point spending a long time styling a plot for this purpose. Getting distracted building a plot is a trap you need to try and avoid during the course of an analysis. Unless the results are final and you are creating something for a publication, this is almost always a waste of time. The key point is that we are able to *see* the model fit and assess it visually. This is one of the most important steps of building a statistical model as there is no substitute for *looking* at the data and understanding what your model is trying to say. If you manage to \"complete\" an analysis without creating any plots, you have not performed the analysis appropriately. "
