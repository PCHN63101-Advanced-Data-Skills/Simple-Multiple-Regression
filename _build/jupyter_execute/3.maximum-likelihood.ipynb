    "# Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "As a brief review, we are now in the position where we have specified the form of model we wish to use on our data. For some continuous outcome variable and some continuous predictor, we start with most simple relationship we can image: a straight-line. We then formalise this by placing it within the context of a statistical model, giving:\n",

    "This is all fine, except that we have not actually done anything yet! All we have done is written down the model equation that we would like to use. However, we cannot do anything with this because it contains *unknown values*. At the point of analysing the data, we have measurements of both $y$ and $x$, but we do *not* have values for:\n",

In this section, we will examine a more generic way of arriving at these values using the *Method of Maximum Likelihood*. In effect, this will provide us with values for all the unknowns above, allowing us to actually perform calculations and reach conclusions using our model. "

    "## Notation for Estimates\n",
    "Before getting to the details of estimation, it is important that we establish some new notation for the estimates themseleves. So far, our notation has implicitly assumed that we are referring to the whole popluation under study. As such, the parameters indicated above represent *population-level constants*. In other words, $\\beta_{0}$ is the *true* intercept and $\\beta_{1}$ is the *true* slope. In reality, however, we will usually only have a *sample* from a population. As such, the parameters we calculate will only be *estimates* of the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, we denote a parameter estimate by placing a \"hat\" on top of the corresponding Greek letter. For instance, we would denote an estimate of $\\beta_{1}$ from a given sample as $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$ (pronounced \"beta 1 hat\"). This is important because whenever we see $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$, this tells us that the value is effectively a *guess* based on a certain sample of data. In comaprison, whenever we see $\\beta_{1}$, this indicates the *true* population value, even though this is largely theoretical and unknowable quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of this distinction then goes further than just indicating that $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$ is an estimate. Because $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$ will change for every new sample we take, its value will shift around. As such, $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$ is a *random variable*. This is important, because $\\beta_{1}$ is *constant* and $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$ is *random*. As such, $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$ has a distribution with an expectation and a variance. We will get into the specifics of this later, but for the moment it is worth noting that an expression such as $E\\left(\\hat{\\beta}_{1}\\right)$ and $\\text{Var}\\left(\\hat{\\beta}_{1}\\right)$ make complete sense because our estimates are *random*, whereas $E\\left(\\beta_{1}\\right)$ and $\\text{Var}\\left(\\beta_{1}\\right)$ do not make sense because the true population values are *constant*. The main take-away here is that you need to keep an eye on those little hats because they make quite a big difference to the meaning."

    "### Errors vs Residuals\n",
    "Another subtle but important difference that we need to understand is that, much like the parameters $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$, the *errors* in the model above are defined at the level of the population. This is important, because their value depends upon $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$. In other words, to get the *true* errors, we would need to know the *true* population values of the parameters. Because this is almost never possible, the errors we actually use are based on the *estimates* $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$. As such, the errors we calculate from our estimated model and likely to be different from the true errors. As such, we make a distinction between *errors* and *residuals*. The *errors* are the true but unknown differences from the population regression line, whereas the *residuals* are the estimated errors based on the estimated regression line.\n",

It is like asking the question: \"how likely would it have been to collect the data that we have collected, if these were the parameter values?\".
