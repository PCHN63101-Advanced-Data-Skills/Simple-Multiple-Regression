    "# Maximum Likelihood\n",

In this section, we will explore a method of estimation known as *maximum likelihood estimation* (MLE) that is applicable to both simple linear models, as well as many of the more complex models we will see later on the course."

    "## MLE vs OLS\n",
    "At the beginning of this lesson, we demonstrated how the simple regression line could be fit by minimising the sum of squared errors. This is known as the method of *ordinary least squares* (OLS). OLS is useful because it is easy to conceptualise and results in a simple set of equations for finding estimates. Because of this, OLS is generally considered *the* method used for estimating linear models. However, models that do not assume a normal distribution or those that assume more complex correlational and variance structures cannot be estimated with OLS. As such, OLS is actually something of a niche approach that gets abandoned quickly as models get more complex. Because of this, it is much more helpful to consider a *likelihood* approach to estimation[^searlefoot]. The principle of the likelihood is widely applicable across may different types of model, as well as being fundamental to Bayesian methods. As such, we can consider MLE as our singular generic method of estimation that will be applicable across this entire course."

Although our outcomes $y$ starts with $n$ degrees of freedom, estimating parameters limits the number of possible values that can be produced by the model. For the residuals, their values are constrained by the parameter estimates. Each new parameter \"uses up\" a single degree of freedom. So if we have $k$ parameters, then the number of residual degrees of freedom is $n-k$. For simple regression, $k = 2$ (the slope and the intercept) and so the first $n-2$ residuals are free to be any possible value, but the value of the final 2 are constrained by the estimated values of $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$. This also has a direct connection with Bessel's correction, because estimating the variance of a sample requires an estimate of the mean.

Unfortunately, this requires a much deeper understanding of linear models than we will have time to establish on this course. In brief, we conceptualise quantities such as the residuals as vectors (arrows) in multidimensional space. The number of dimensions these vectors occupy is given by the degrees of freedom. As such, to compare vectors that lie in different numbers of dimensions, we summarise them by producing an *average value per-dimension*. This makes the act of dividing quantities by their degrees of freedom make more sense, but this is not a perspective we would recommend trying to master at this stage. However, it is worth knowing that a more intuitive perspective on degrees of freedom does exist, if you want to look into it at a later date.\n",

    "[^bayesfoot]: This may seem like the wrong quantity. Surely, we are interested in $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})$? In other words, finding the parameters that are most probable, given the data. Unfortunately, evaluating the probability $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})$ requires Bayesian methods and so cannot be evaluated from a purely Frequentist perspective.\n",

    "[^minmaxfoot]: Making the *negative* log-likelihood *smaller* is the same as making the *positive* log-likelihood *bigger*. All we need to do to turn a maxmisation problem into a minimisation problem is to multiply the value of the objective function by $-1$.\n",

    "[^searlefoot]: This is the perspective taken by [McCulloch, Searle & Neuhaus (2008)](https://www.librarysearch.manchester.ac.uk/permalink/44MAN_INST/1r887gn/alma9930787964401631), who are leading experts on the use of linear models within statistics."
