    "# Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "In the previous section, we discussed estimation of the simple regression model very generally, establishing that we could use *either* MLE or OLS to arrive at the same results. As argued in that section, although OLS is conceptually simple, it is limited in its application to the more complex models that we will be encountering later on the course. As such, it is useful to focus primarily on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) as a general method that can be used to estimate values across a variety of models. In this section, we will dig into MLE in a bit more detail to give you a sense of how it works and, also, to show how the results are identical to OLS."

So just try to gain some intution here and do not worry about understanding every detail. \n",

We can think about it as taking a guess for the parameter values, then calculating how probable those values make the data we have collected. It is like asking the question: \"how likely would it have been to collect the data that we have collected, if these were the parameter values?\". By searching through lots of different possible combinations of parameter values, the aim is to find the specific combination that leads to the *highest probability* of the data.

    "[^likprobsfoot]: This is often a problem of just getting values of 0 due to issues with computational precision when working with many small probabilities. Taking logs not only changes the scale so that this does not happen, but it also turns *multiplication* into *summation*. Historically, this made calculating the likelihood much easier by hand. If you ever want to get back to the likelihood value, you can just undo the logs by using `exp(loglik)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^bayesfoot]: This may seem like the wrong quantity. Surely, we are interested in $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})$? In other words, finding the parameters that are most probable, given the data. Unfortunately, evaluating the probability $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})$ requires Bayesian methods and so cannot be evaluated from a purely Frequentist perspective. This is why the likelihood has such an awkward definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^minmaxfoot]: Making the *negative* log-likelihood *smaller* is the same as making the *positive* log-likelihood *bigger*. All we need to do to turn a maxmisation problem into a minimisation problem is to multiply the value returned by the function by $-1$."
